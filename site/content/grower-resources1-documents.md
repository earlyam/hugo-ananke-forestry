So how did this happen? When I changed site/content/**/* to content/* ??? Where did the URL come from - page crashed and when Forestry reimported it guessed ? ("Guessing" is in the docs.)

Forestry can be pointed to any file that contains Markdown. So now it will show up after saving? (It didn't before typing this, but maybe caches needed to be cleared.)

Still stuck. Been stuck for about 10 days...or is it 17...
